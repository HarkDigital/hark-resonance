/*
 * Reference-counted "something opaque covers the scene" holds. The loader's
 * sound gate, the phone-landscape rotate card and the fully open mobile menu
 * each hide the WebGL scene completely; while any of them holds, the engine
 * skips rendering (engine.paused) so an unseen scene never burns battery.
 *
 * Holds may be taken before the engine exists (the rotate card mounts on the
 * very first frame); they apply the moment bindScene() is called.
